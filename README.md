Hi, I'm Sabah
**Data & AI Consultant | Building digital products | Turning data into decisions**

I work at the intersection of data, AI, and product. Analysing full-funnel performance across global markets, building ML models that solve real problems, and creating digital tools that help people make better decisions.  

On this GitHub, you’ll find:
- 📊 **Analytics tools** for KPI benchmarking, funnel diagnostics, and performance modelling  
- 🤖 **Machine learning projects** including classification, regression, clustering, uplift modelling and journey prediction  
- 📱 **Product experiments** like The Reinvention Edit — a React Native app designed to guide career, finance, and lifestyle reinvention  
- 🛠️ **Utilities & reproducible examples** using Python, SQL, Jupyter, and modern ML workflows  

I am especially interested in:
- Practical ML that drives measurable impact  
- Personalisation, experimentation, and customer behaviour analytics  
- GenAI + product thinking  
- Building empowering products for women in tech and beyond  

Always open to collaboration, interesting datasets, or building something new.
